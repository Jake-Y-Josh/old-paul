# Dynamic FP Feedback System - Security & Compliance Documentation

## Overview
This document details the security measures and compliance features implemented in the Dynamic FP Feedback System. The application is designed to maintain data privacy and security, particularly important for financial advisers who handle sensitive client information and are subject to regulatory requirements.

## Data Security Measures

### 1. Database Security
- **Encrypted Connections**: All database connections use TLS/SSL encryption to protect data in transit
- **Secure Credentials**: Database credentials are stored in environment variables, not in the codebase
- **Connection Pooling**: Uses PostgreSQL connection pooling for efficient and secure database access
- **Prepared Statements**: All database queries use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection

### 2. Authentication & Authorization
- **Password Security**: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with strong salt rounds (10+)
- **Session Management**: Uses secure, HTTP-only session cookies with appropriate expiration
- **Role-Based Access**: Clear separation between admin and client access
- **Authentication Middleware**: Protected routes require authentication before access is granted

### 3. Data Transmission
- **HTTPS/TLS**: All data transmission occurs over encrypted HTTPS connections
- **Email Security**: Emails are sent via secure SMTP connections using TLS
- **API Security**: API endpoints are protected with appropriate authentication

### 4. Application Security
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated on both client and server
- **Content Security**: Implemented headers to prevent XSS and other injection attacks
- **File Upload Security**: Strict file type validation and size limits on uploaded files
- **Error Handling**: Secure error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information

### 5. Infrastructure Security
- **Environment Isolation**: Development, staging, and production environments are isolated
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive configuration is stored in environment variables
- **Regular Updates**: Dependencies are kept updated to address security vulnerabilities

## User Management

The application includes a comprehensive user management system that allows:

1. **Admin Access Control**: Only authorized administrators can access the admin dashboard
2. **User Creation**: Ability to create staff user accounts with appropriate permissions
3. **Password Policies**: Enforces strong password requirements
4. **User Activity Logging**: Tracks user actions for audit purposes
5. **Default Admin Segregation**: The default admin account is separated from regular user accounts

## Compliance Features

### 1. Audit Trail
- **Activity Logging**: All significant actions are logged with user ID, timestamp, IP address, and action details
- **Email Logs**: Complete records of all emails sent to clients
- **Form Submission History**: Full history of client form submissions

### 2. Data Handling
- **Data Minimization**: Only collects necessary client information
- **Data Access Controls**: Access to client data is restricted based on user roles
- **Data Retention**: Appropriate data retention policies are implemented

### 3. Client Communications
- **Consent Management**: Records client consent for communications
- **Secure Messaging**: All client communications are transmitted securely

## Regular Maintenance & Security Practices

To maintain security and compliance over time:

1. **Regular Backups**: Database is backed up regularly
2. **Dependency Updates**: Regular updates to all dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities
3. **Periodic Security Reviews**: Code and configuration are reviewed for security issues
4. **Incident Response Plan**: Documented procedures for handling security incidents

## Future Enhancements

The following security enhancements are planned for future updates:

1. **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Add 2FA for admin access
2. **Enhanced Audit Logging**: More comprehensive logging of all system activities
3. **Automated Security Scanning**: Integration with security scanning tools
4. **Client Data Encryption at Rest**: Implementation of field-level encryption for sensitive client data

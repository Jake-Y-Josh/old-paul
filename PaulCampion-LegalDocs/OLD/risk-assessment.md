**Version 1.0**
**Date: March 21, 2025**

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Risk Assessment identifies, analyzes, and evaluates potential risks to the Dynamic FP Feedback System. It documents existing controls and recommends additional measures to mitigate identified risks to acceptable levels.

### 1.2 Scope
This assessment covers all aspects of the Dynamic FP Feedback System, including:
- Application security
- Data protection
- Infrastructure security
- Third-party dependencies
- Operational processes
- Regulatory compliance

### 1.3 Methodology
This assessment follows a structured approach:
1. Identify assets and their value
2. Identify threats and vulnerabilities
3. Assess likelihood and impact
4. Evaluate existing controls
5. Determine risk levels
6. Recommend additional controls where needed
